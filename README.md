# Project-GetData-034
#
This project uses a single script named run_analysis.R which creates a tidy data file (tidydata.txt) that aggregates the data stored in the Dataset UCI HAR and calculates the mean value of 66 variables extracted from this dataset.

In order to successfully execute the script, perform the following steps:
 
* Download the dataset UCI HAR from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Unzip the files in a working folder in your file system.
* Add the run_analysis.R script in the root folder where you placed the unzipped dataset
* Start R studio and change the working directory to the root directory where you placed the files and the script.
* Execute the script in Rstudio. After completion, look for the file named tidydata.txt in the working directory.
